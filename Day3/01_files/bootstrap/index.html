            “We were summoned to eat at dusk by a bell, bronze struck from deep
            in the palace’s turnings. The boys dropped their games and tumbled
            out into the hallway. The complex was built like a rabbit warren,
            full of twisting corridors and sudden inner rooms. I nearly tripped
            over the heels of the boy in front of me, fearful of being left
            behind and lost.” Excerpt From: Madeline Miller. “The Song of

            "IT IS A TRUTH universally acknowledged, that a single man in
            possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However
            little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first
            entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
            of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
            property of some one or other of their daughters." Excerpt From:

            gown and twitched the train into perfect folds, but she’d caught
            their looks of pity mixed with horror from the corner of her eye.
            Ildiko told herself to ignore them. Arranged marriages were the fate
            of nearly all aristocratic Gauri women, each one made for power, for
            trade, for good of country. His Majesty, Sangur the Lame, had
            married off both his daughters to princes of foreign lands as part
            of the negotiations for access to ports and allies in war." Excerpt

            "It was a nice day. All the days had been nice. There had been
            rather more than seven of them so far, and rain hadn't been invented
            yet. But clouds massing east of Eden suggested that the first
            thunderstorm was on its way, and it was going to be a big one. The
            angel of the Eastern Gate put his wings over his head to shield
            himself from the first drops. "I'm sorry," he said politely. "What
            was it you were saying?" "I said, that one went down like a lead
            balloon," said the serpent. "Oh. Yes," said the angel, whose name
            was Aziraphale. "I think it was a bit of an overreaction, to be
            honest," said the serpent. "I mean, first offense and everything. I
            can't see what's so bad about knowing the difference between good
            and evil, anyway." Excerpt From: Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman.
